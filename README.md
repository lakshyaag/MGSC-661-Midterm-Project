## Introduction

**The final report can be found [here](./deliverables/midterm_cinemettrics.pdf).**

This repository contains the code by Group 3 for the 2023 IMDb Rating Prediction Project. The goal is to predict the IMDb ratings of the twelve upcoming blockbusters.

After data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, we fit three regression models to predict the IMDb ratings. We then compare the performance of these models to select the best one.

   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/lakshyaag/MGSC-661-Midterm-Project
